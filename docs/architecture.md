# Biz-App System Architecture Document

## Document Information
Version: 1.0
Date: August 2025
Purpose: Define the technical architecture and system design for Biz-App

## Architecture Overview

Biz-App is built as a modern full-stack web application using a TypeScript-first approach with a monorepo structure. The system follows a clean separation between frontend and backend services while maintaining type safety across the entire stack.

### High-Level Architecture Flow
